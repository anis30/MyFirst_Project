How do you manage version control?

Centralized Version Control (What if the server down?)

Repository (central server)
       |
commit | update
       |
Working copy (Workstation/pc)


Distributed Version Control 

Repository (Central Server)(Github)
       |
 pull  | push
       |
Repository (local repo)(Git)
       |
commit | update
       |
Working copy (Workstation/pc)


Repository - special location where git lock all the codes in a secret location 

git status - On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean

git commit - On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean
git add JavaNotes8Nov.txt
